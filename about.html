<h1>About King</h1>

Hi there! My name is King, and I'm a loyal and energetic German Shepherd with a big heart and an even bigger appetite.<br/> My humans gave me this regal name because they say I rule the backyard like royalty.<br/> But don't let my noble title fool you—I’m all about fun, adventure, and the occasional belly rub.<br/>

What do I love most? Playing ball! Throw it once, and I’m off like a rocket, ready to bring it back (and maybe keep it for a bit longer than you'd like).<br/> Whether it's fetch in the park or a game of chase around the yard, I'm always up for some action.<br/>

After a long day of being the best boy, I work up quite the appetite.<br/> Treats? Yes, please. Dinner time? My favorite time of the day.<br/> I’m always sniffing out new snacks, but I have a soft spot for anything my humans let me munch on.<br/>

When I’m not chasing balls or enjoying a good meal, I’m keeping a watchful eye on my family.<br/> Protecting them is my job, and I take it seriously. But don’t worry—if you’re a friend, you’ll be greeted with lots of tail wags and slobbery kisses.<br/>

Life is simple and sweet when you’re a dog named King.<br/> If you ever want to meet me, just bring a ball and maybe a snack—we’ll be best friends in no time! <br/>
